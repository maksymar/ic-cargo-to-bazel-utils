# ic-cargo-to-bazel-utils

## Goal

Help with `Cargo` to `Bazel` migration for [Internet Computer](https://github.com/dfinity/ic) repository.
This tool should help with:

- understanding the progress (how much is already done?)
- optimizing the migration, by pointing to the next package for conversion
